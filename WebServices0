Question : All the servers where connected together is what we call the internet right?

GPT answers:
	You're very close ‚Äî let's clarify it:
		‚úÖ Yes, all the servers (and devices) connected together globally form what we 		call the Internet ‚Äî but it's a bit more than just servers.
	What is the Internet, Really?
		The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers, servers, routers, 	and devices that communicate using standardized protocols (like TCP/IP).
	It includes:
		Servers (that host websites, apps, data, etc.)
		Clients (your phone, laptop, smart TV, etc.)
		Routers and switches (that route data)
		ISPs (Internet Service Providers) that provide access
		Protocols that govern communication (like HTTP, FTP, TCP/IP)
	Think of it like this:
		The Internet is the highway system.
		Servers are like shops, offices, or service centers connected to the highway.
		Your device (browser) is the car that drives around asking for information.
	How It Works (Simplified Flow):
		You type a website (e.g., google.com) into your browser.
		Your device sends a request through your ISP to a DNS server (like a phonebook) 	to find the server's IP address.
		Your request travels across routers, switches, and cables to reach that server.
		The server responds with the web page, which your browser displays.

Question: Then what is world wide web?
 
GPT answers:
	      The World Wide Web (WWW) and the Internet are not the same, though they are closely related.                                                                                                  
	      The Internet vs. The Web		
		| Term                     | Definition                                                                                                                |
		| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
		| **Internet**             | The **physical network** of computers, servers, cables, routers, etc. that allows devices to communicate globally.        |
		| **World Wide Web (WWW)** | A **service on top of the Internet** that uses **web browsers** and **web pages**. It's just one way we use the Internet. |
													
	      What is the World Wide Web?
	      The World Wide Web is:
			A collection of interlinked web pages and resources that are accessed using the HTTP/HTTPS protocol, viewed through a web browser.
			Invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989
			Uses URLs (web addresses) to locate resources
			Delivered using HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
	      Analogy
		Imagine:
			The Internet is like a giant city with roads and infrastructure.
			The Web is like a library or app store inside that city.
			Other services like email, file transfers (FTP), online gaming, and video calls also use the Internet ‚Äî but they're not part of the Web.
		Services that use the Internet (but aren't WWW):
			Email (SMTP, IMAP)
			FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
			VoIP (Voice over IP) like Skype, Zoom
			Chat apps like WhatsApp, Discord
			Online games
		In short:
			| Component          | Function                                                                         |
			| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
			| **Internet**       | The global network (hardware + software) that connects everything                |
			| **World Wide Web** | A system of web pages and sites accessed via browsers (runs **on** the Internet) |

Question: So the www is only for the websites and webpages right?

GPT answers:
 	Exactly! You're spot on.
	To summarize:
		The World Wide Web (WWW) is only for websites and web pages.
	It includes:
		HTML pages
		CSS styling
		JavaScript-powered interactions
		Images, videos, and documents embedded in webpages
		Web apps (like Gmail, YouTube, online shops)
	Important Clarification:
		| Feature                       | WWW (Web) ‚úÖ | Internet üåê |
		| ----------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
		| Websites/webpages             | ‚úÖ           | ‚úÖ           |
		| Email                         | ‚ùå           | ‚úÖ           |
		| Online games (not in browser) | ‚ùå           | ‚úÖ           |
		| File sharing (FTP, torrents)  | ‚ùå           | ‚úÖ           |
		| Zoom/Skype video calls        | ‚ùå           | ‚úÖ           |
		| WhatsApp messages             | ‚ùå           | ‚úÖ           |

	So:
	    The Web = Just the "website part" of the Internet
	    The Internet = Everything: websites, email, games, apps, file sharing, etc.

Question: If i open the gmail via a browser that comes under the www whereas if I open it via the app that wont comes under www right? Is there anything like this www?

GPT answers:
	You're thinking exactly right, and that‚Äôs a very insightful question! Let's break it down:

	Your Example: Gmail
		| How You Access Gmail        | Uses WWW?  | Uses Internet?   |
		| --------------------------- | ---------  | --------------   |
		| **Browser (gmail.com)**     | ‚úÖ Yes     | ‚úÖ Yes          |
		| **Gmail App (Android/iOS)** | ‚ùå No      | ‚úÖ Yes          |

	When you use Gmail in a browser, you're loading web pages (HTML, CSS, JS) ‚Üí this is part of the World Wide Web (WWW).
	When you use the Gmail app, it talks to Gmail servers via APIs ‚Äî it's not loading a webpage, so it‚Äôs not part of WWW, but still uses the Internet.
	So is there anything else like the WWW?
		Yes ‚Äî the World Wide Web is just one service that runs on the Internet. Here are some others:
		| Service Name                                   | Description                       | Runs on Internet? | Part of WWW? |
		| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
		| **Email (SMTP/IMAP)**                          | Sends and receives email messages | ‚úÖ Yes             | ‚ùå No         |
		| **VoIP (Skype, Zoom)**                         | Voice/Video over IP               | ‚úÖ Yes             | ‚ùå No         |
		| **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**               | Used to transfer files            | ‚úÖ Yes             | ‚ùå No         |
		| **DNS (Domain Name System)**                   | Resolves website names to IPs     | ‚úÖ Yes             | ‚ùå No         |
		| **Chat Apps (WhatsApp, Signal)**               | Send messages through app APIs    | ‚úÖ Yes             | ‚ùå No         |
		| **Cloud Services (Dropbox, Google Drive app)** | Sync files                        | ‚úÖ Yes             | ‚ùå No         |

	Simple Analogy:
		The Internet is like a giant delivery network (like roads and highways).
		The World Wide Web is like one specific service that delivers web pages over those roads.
		Other services (email, chat, video, etc.) use those same roads but deliver different types of packages.
																				
Question : How you would give the SMTP,IMAP,FTP? Because these are the protocols like HTTP which was in the world wide web right?																					
GPT answers:
		You‚Äôre absolutely right again ‚Äî SMTP, IMAP, FTP, and HTTP are all protocols, and yes, they all run over the Internet. The key difference lies in what they‚Äôre used for, which 	determines whether they're part of the World Wide Web (WWW) or not.
	Let‚Äôs break it down clearly:																			
		What is a Protocol?
			A protocol is a set of rules that defines how data is exchanged between computers over a network.
		Key Protocols on the Internet
			| Protocol       | Full Form                            | Purpose                                 | Part of WWW? | Uses Internet? |
			| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
			| **HTTP/HTTPS** | HyperText Transfer Protocol (Secure) | Transfers web pages, used by browsers   | ‚úÖ Yes        | ‚úÖ Yes          |
			| **SMTP**       | Simple Mail Transfer Protocol        | Sends email from a client to a server   | ‚ùå No         | ‚úÖ Yes          |
			| **IMAP**       | Internet Message Access Protocol     | Reads email from server (keeps copy)    | ‚ùå No         | ‚úÖ Yes          |
			| **POP3**       | Post Office Protocol v3              | Downloads and removes email from server | ‚ùå No         | ‚úÖ Yes          |
			| **FTP**        | File Transfer Protocol               | Transfers files between computers       | ‚ùå No         | ‚úÖ Yes          |
			| **DNS**        | Domain Name System                   | Resolves domain names to IP addresses   | ‚ùå No         | ‚úÖ Yes          |

		So Why Is HTTP Part of the Web, But Others Aren‚Äôt?
			Because:
				The World Wide Web (WWW) specifically refers to resources (web pages, web apps) accessed using HTTP/HTTPS, viewed through browsers.
				Other protocols like SMTP, IMAP, FTP work behind the scenes or in apps/tools, not through webpages.
		Simple Analogy:
			Imagine the Internet as a huge shipping network (like FedEx):
				| Protocol | Like...               | What it ships                   |
				| -------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
				| HTTP     | A book delivery truck | Web pages, videos, site content |
				| SMTP     | A mail van            | Outgoing emails                 |
				| IMAP     | A post office locker  | Incoming emails                 |
				| FTP      | A moving truck        | Files like software, documents  |

		Only HTTP trucks go to the public library (your browser) ‚Äî that‚Äôs the Web. The rest are still part of the shipping system, just delivering to different places.

		Final Summary
			HTTP/HTTPS = Protocols used by the World Wide Web
			SMTP, IMAP, FTP, etc. = Other Internet protocols, not part of the Web
			They all use the Internet, but only HTTP-based services are considered part of the WWW
